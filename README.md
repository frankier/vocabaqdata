# Vocabulary acquisition datasets

This repository contains a Snakemake workflow to do some preparation of various
datasets relevant to modelling vocabulary with an eye towards modelling
receptive vocabulary inventories. It can also do some enrichment of the data.
The output formats are DuckDB and Arrow tables, which can be used comfortably
from Python or R.

## Vocabulary inventory datasets

These datasets 

L1Ls = 1nd language learners
L2Ls = 2nd language learners

[//]: # (START_TABLE)
[//]: # (END_TABLE)

## Relevant word features

These datasets include features of words which are highly relevant to
vocabulary inventory modelling. The most important beyond frequency, which is
not covered here are age of acquisition and concreteness.
